# Functional, Data Science Intro To Python
The first section is an intentionally brief, functional, data science centric introduction to Python.  The assumption is a someone with zero experience in programming can follow this tutorial and learn Python with the smallest amount of information possible.

The sections after that, involve varying levels of difficulty and cover topics as diverse as Machine Learning, Linear Optimization, build systems, commandline tools, recommendation engines, Sentiment Analysis and Cloud Computing.
